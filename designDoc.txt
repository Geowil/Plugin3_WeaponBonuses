User Story:
	As a developer, I would like to be able to give certain weapons a bonus to the damage that they do on attack.
	This damage bonus should be able to be applied to any or all types of attacks.

Requirements:
	Write a plugin
		Plugin Settings:
			Enable Weapon Bonuses
				True/False
				Allows for the system to start enabled or disabled.

		Plugin Commands:
			EnableWeaponBonuses
				Parameters:
					Boolean
						True/False
				Allows the weapon damage bonus system to be disabled or enabled from in-game through a plugin command.

		Script Calls:
			None

		Notetag:
			Weapon:
				Bonus
					Decimal
					Positive/Negative

				BonusFormula
					String
					The formula that will be used to modify attack damage

				SkillType
					Integer
					ID for the skill type that this bonus should apply to.  If 0 is used, it applies to all skill types.

	How should this be used?
		Notetags are added to the note boxes of the weapons that should be used by the system.  On attack, calculated damage
		is modified using the bonus and bonus formula for the applicable skill types configured.


	Edge Case:
		BonusFormula is invalid or contains invalid variable names
			Problem:
				This will cause the game to crash as eval expects the information a string to be present and properly formatted

			Handle:
				Wrap the eval statement in a try/catch.  On failure, use unmodified damage.

		Invalid skill type id is used
			Problem:
				If the skill type id is not valid, this might cause crashes or at the very least would result in abberant
				behaviors within the plugin.

			Handle:
				Check if the id exists and if not use the unmodified damage.
